								Poised to radically reconfigure the crypto-asset
								market, non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are
								revolutionizing our conception of money and
								value, creating not just entirely new markets
								but even new economies that are able to scale
								globally and to discover value in undreamt
								places, relegating to oblivion fiat currencies
								and old ways of doing business..

							<h2>
								Selling Condition Tearms & Condition of Nuron
							</h2>
							<p>
								Just kidding. The previous paragraph is a parody
								(if such is possible) of the hype that in the
								first half of has come to surround non-fungible
								tokens. Indeed, the hype has become so
								overpowering that it may even defy parody.
								Non-fungible tokens can have legitimacy, and
								I’ll discuss how that can be at the end of this
								article. But for now the overwhelming majority
								of what passes for NFTs is delusion, fueled by
								the hope of a quick return and the belief that
								something can be gotten for nothing (or
								virtually nothing).
							</p>
							<p>
								This is where I can explain and emphasize the
								“non-fungibility” property of NFTs. The main
								difference between NFTs and Bitcoins is the fact
								that Bitcoins are limited, and fungible (you can
								trade one Bitcoin with another and both have the
								same value and price). NFTs are unique but
								unlimited, and non-fungible (no two artworks are
								the same). While NFTs can appreciate in value
								(just like real estate), they cannot be
								interchanged for another NFT.
							</p>

							<h2>NFT Bidding Terms & Condition of Nuron</h2>
							<p>
								Warren Buffett famously remarked in 2018 that
								Bitcoin (and by implication all
								cryptocurrencies) were “probably rat poison
								squared.” That seems unduly pessimistic given
								that cryptocurrencies provide a way of securely
								moving around things that at least look like
								currency and that in some locales are actually
								being used like currency. In Venezuela, for
								instance, Bitcoin provides one way around the
								country’s corrupt central bank and the
								hyperinflation it has created. And in early June
								of , the El Salvador government even approved
								Bitcoin as legal tender.
							</p>
							<p>
								While not directly related to NFTs, it’s
								important to mention some properties of money.
								Among many properties, money has to be fungible
								(one unit is viewed as interchangeable as
								another), and divisible (can be divided into
								smaller units of value). NFTs are not fungible
								nor (easily) divisible. For example, a single
								dollar is easily convertible into four quarters
								or ten dimes, but currently you cannot divide
								one NFT (although the blockchain technology
								behind may allow it in future).

							<h2>Buying NFT's Terms & Condition of Nuron</h2>
							<p>
								The importance of NFTs lies in providing the
								ability to securely value, purchase and exchange
								digital art using a digital ledger. NFTs started
								in online gaming, later with Nike’s patenting of
								its authenticity (CryptoKicks) and then by the
								famous Christie’s auction embracing NFT
								valuation of a digital art piece. NFTs are
								commonly created by uploading files, such as
								digital artwork, to an auction market. Just like
								any other form of art, NFTs are not mutually
								interchangeable, making them more like
								“collectible” items.
